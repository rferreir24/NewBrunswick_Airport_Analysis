# New Brunswick Airport Analysis
This project aims to identify an optimal location for an airport in New Brunswick, Canada, within the area between Fredericton, Moncton, and Saint John. 
The analysis process carried out in Arc GIS Pro considered restricted zones and excluded existing airports and powerlines from the potential site.

The findings and analysis were presented as part of the University of New Brunswick's GGE 3423 (Introduction to Geographic Information Systems) course held in Fall '23
. The slides from the presentation are included in Airport_Analysis.pdf.
